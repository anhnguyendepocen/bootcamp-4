A `data.frame`

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
head(mtcars)
dim(mtcars)
class(mtcars)
```

Make a SQLite database

```{r, message=FALSE}
db <- src_sqlite(":memory:", create = TRUE)
mtcars2 <- mtcars %>%
  tibble::rownames_to_column(var = "model") %>%
  copy_to(dest = db, df = .)
dim(mtcars2)
head(mtcars2)
class(mtcars2)
```

Get some results

```{r}
# works
mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarize(N = n(), avg_mpg = mean(mpg), 
            range = paste(mean(mpg), mean(disp), sep = "-"))

# works now, but didn't use to!
mtcars2 %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarize(N = n(), avg_mpg = mean(mpg), 
            range = paste(mean(mpg), mean(disp), sep = "-")) %>%
  show_query()

mtcars3 <- mtcars2 %>% 
  collect()
```


```{r, error=TRUE}
# works, but why???
mtcars2 %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarize(N = n(), avg_mpg = mean(mpg), 
            range = avg(mpg) %||% "-" %||% mean(disp)) %>%
  show_query()
```

## Connect to PostgreSQL

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
db <- src_postgres(
  dbname = "postgres", 
  host = "localhost", port = 5432, 
  user = "postgres", password = "postgres"
)
class(db)
str(db)
```

Connect to a real database

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
db <- src_postgres(
  dbname = "imdb", 
  host = "localhost", port = 5432, 
  user = "postgres", password = "postgres"
)
src_tbls(db)
movies <- tbl(db, "movies")
movies
```

Compare memory footprints

```{r}
print(object.size(movies), units = "Kb")
print(object.size(movies %>% collect()), units = "Kb")
```

```{r}
DBI::dbGetQuery(db$con, "SELECT people.name, 
           COUNT(DISTINCT movies.title) as num_films 
           FROM movies 
           JOIN cast_info ON movies.id = cast_info.movie_id 
           JOIN people ON people.id = cast_info.person_id 
           GROUP BY people.id 
           ORDER BY num_films desc 
           LIMIT 10;")
```
